unclear how they got their superintelligent AI, probably a remnant from the previous civilization

National Guard:

vaguely humanitarian purely for PR reasons
actually dont give a shit about the people
corrupt and mismanaged as shit

just people that united for mutual defense 
if enough communities form militias, become major united faction

Player is usually one of these
Ideologies vary wildly
